# ProffieConfig FAQ

## What is a config file?

The ProffieOS config file is what holds all the information about your saber setup. It contains (mostly) all the settings you configure within ProffieConfig, and then some.

The code for your styles, the layout/setup of your blades, the the options you choose for things like volume, the prop options, etc. all get stored in the config file, which is then read when the ProffieOS code is compiled (fancy computer term for "turned into a program," in this case, for the Proffieboard to run).

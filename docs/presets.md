## Presets Page

Here you'll setup all the *things* that happen when you turn on your saber: what sounds it plays, what effects occur on your blades, etc.
Through this section you can add new fonts and bladestyles to your saber. Click the "+" button to add another preset entry, in which you can specify a new font/bladstyle pair.

## Preset Name

This entry has two purposes:
A) To serve as a name simply for organizational/recall purposes, and
B) To choose what text to display on an OLED, provided no custom bitmaps are shown.

Any name can be used, but it cannot contain spaces. If you're setting up a name for an OLED, it's best practice to use lowercase, and if you want to put text on a new line, insert "\n" as if it were a space or enter key.

## Font Directory

This is the directory where the soundfont files will be found to play.

This is a location of a folder on your saber SD card, and if you have a soundfont folder inside another folder, you'll have to indicate that by doing something like `FolderName/FontFolderName`.

You can specify multiple folders to pull sound files from here. For example, if you had a "common" folder which holds things like menu effect files or similar, you could specify it by doing something like `FontFolderName;common`. The `;` seperates folders, and you can have multiple.

What you enter into this field should exactly match the Font Folder name, and the folder names cannot contain spaces. For example, if you have a font folder named "My Cool Font," you'd need to change the folder name to something like "My-Cool-Font," and then enter in exactly that in ProffieConfig. If you had such a folder and you entered in "my-cool-font" it would not work. This is case-sensitive.

## Track File

This can point to any audio file on the SD card. Whether you keep your tracks in a "track" folder, or if they're inside your font folder, they have to be referenced from the start of the SD card folders, it's not relative to the soundfont folder they may be in. Similarly, this field cannot contain spaces, and will always end in ".wav," (unless the field is left blank, which is valid) which is the file extension for the audio files.

## List

The list in the center of the page allows you to navigate between presets, select which blade you're editing the style for, and add and remove presets. Presets will be added automatically if you type into the name, directory, or track fields and there's no preset selected. Pressing "+" will add a preset. Pressing "-" will remove the preset currently selected, if there is one.

## Blade Style Editor

The box on the right of the page is where you'll input the bladestyle for the specific blade for the specific preset you have selected. This bladestyle is the code which creates the effect to be displayed on your blade (See ["Where do I get blade styles?"](/docs/faq.md#where-do-i-get-blade-styles)) and depending on the style they may be dependent on a particular Prop file or feature.

This field auto-populates with `StyleNormalPtr<AudioFlicker<Blue, DodgerBlue>, BLUE, 300, 800>()` which is a basic example of a bladestyle, with a simple in, out, and audioflicker, essentially doing the bare minimum, and should be replaced with your own.

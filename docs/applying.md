# Applying Config to Proffieboard

First, be sure you've completed the [first-time setup](/docs/firstsetup.md), then proceed with the instructions below.

- Plug your proffieboard into your computer, and then press "Refresh..."
- Select the port your board is connected to from the "Select Device..." drop down. If you only have one proffieboard plugged in, this will likely be the only option listed.
- Ensure you've selected the correct board version in "General" as the one you have plugged in.
- Click "Apply to Board..." and wait for the changes to be made. This process can take a while, don't panic if it appears to be stuck for around a minute, give it some time to complete.

If your board isn't showing up, and/or if you accidentally disconnected it during the application process, review ["What if my board doesn't show up?"](/docs/faq.md#what-if-my-board-doesnt-show-up)

## That's It!

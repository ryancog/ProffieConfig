# First-Time Setup

When you [download ProffieConfig](https://github.com/ryryog25/ProffieConfig/releases/latest), there's a few steps you'll need to complete to get up and running.

If you're on macOS, you'll get an app which you can move to wherever is convenient.
If you're on Windows, you can move the folder to any location, however the folder must stay together (`ProffieConfig.exe` must stay beside `resources` folder)

## Config File
Open up the application. When you run it for the first time you'll get a pop-up asking if you'd like to import an existing configuration file.

If you bought your saber from someone who included a config file on the SD card, you have a config file from another saber, or if you have one you have created previously, go ahead and import that file (`File->Import Config...`), and ProffieConfig will automatically update accordingly. From here on out, you won't need that file anymore, the information is handled seperatetly within ProffieConfig, just be sure to hit save. ;)

If you don't have a config file, you can decline and an empty configuration will be loaded.

## Install Dependencies

Once you're at the main ProffieConfig window, select `File->Install Dependencies...` to automatically install any drivers or other software needed for ProffieConfig to function. This step can take a while depending on your internet connection since certain components will need to be downloaded.
Once you're done, you won't have to do this again, and ProffieConfig will be ready to work.

## Done!

# Prop File

This page contains prop-specific options related to the way your saber works.

## Prop Dropdown

Here you can choose the prop file to use for your saber. Generally, the biggest difference between prop files is the button layout, though some props offer certain features others don't. In the dropdown, select a prop file (Each of them are the names/aliases of the authors of the prop file), and try one out!

## Prop Options/Buttons

Prop options are generally straightforward, but they can be complex to understand, especially with the wide array of potential choices. For a detailed listing of the capabilites and button mappings for each prop file, check out their respective pages:

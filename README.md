# ProffieConfig

All-In-One ProffieBoard (Created by Fredrik Hubbinette) utility for customization. Handles the installation of all tools needed in the background, and presents an easy to use GUI for configuration and applying changes (flashing) to the board.

Using this tool, there is no need for the Arduino IDE, Zadig, etc. in an attempt to make using a Proffieboard as beginner-friendly as possible, while still retaining as much of the powerful customization which makes proffie so popular.

Utilzes `arduino-cli` and `proffie-dfu-setup` for driver installation and flashing.

## Usage

To get started, head over to [the docs](/docs/README.md) which contain all the information needed to setup and use ProffieConfig.
The tool is fairly straightforward, however it's recommended to read these over to ensure there is no confusion or unexpected issues when using the tool.

## To-Do (Non-Exhaustive)
- Implement "Advanced Mode" interface for custom config file sections
- Expand pre-checker capabilities
- Implement interface for `using` syntax (not just the ability to parse)
- Come up with a better method for dealing with Power Pins to allow custom pins
- Fix SubBladeWithStride generation
- Add new clash settings per [Clash Settings and Questions](https://crucible.hubbe.net/t/clash-settings-and-questions)
- Take over the world ;)

All-In-One ProffieBoard Management Utility. 

Incorporates extensive configuration generation, compiling and applying changes to the ProffieBoard, the Serial Monitor, handles driver installation, and some sanity checks for good measure; All without the Arduino IDE. 

Using this tool, there is no need for dealing with the Arduino IDE, Zadig, etc. in an attempt to make using a Proffieboard as beginner-friendly as possible, while still retaining as much of the powerful customization which makes Proffie so popular.

## Getting Started

Head over to the [latest ProffieConfig release](https://github.com/ryryog25/ProffieConfig/releases/latest), grab either the macOS or Windows (Win32) version depending on which you use, unzip the folder, and run it! 

ProffieConfig will guide you through the setup and all of its features, so whether you're a first-time proffieboard user or have been around the block a few times, you'll be ready in no time!

***NOTE for macOS:** You'll have to right click on ProffieConfig in Finder after downloading and select "Open" due to macOS' strict security. (This is simply because I don't pay for an Apple license)*

***NOTE for Windows:** If Windows warns about the program being dangerous (Windows Security is just based on # of downloads or paying for license, so there's not much I can do about this), simply click "More Info..." and then you should be able to Run Anyways.*

***NOTE for Chrome Browser Users:** If chrome doesn't allow you to keep the file due to it being "Dangerous" (for essentially the same reasons as above), click the button to "Show all downloads" and then you can opt to keep the file from there.*



## To-Do (Non-Exhaustive)
- Expand pre-checker capabilities (ongoing)
- Implement interface for `using` syntax (not just the ability to parse)
- Add blade nicknames
- Update power pin selection to new list style for blade awareness
- Add support for `DimBlade()`
- Take over the world ;)

All-In-One ProffieBoard Management Utility. 

Incorporates extensive configuration generation, compiling and applying changes to the ProffieBoard, the Serial Monitor, handles driver installation, and some sanity checks for good measure; All without the Arduino IDE. 

Using this tool, there is no need for dealing with the Arduino IDE, Zadig, etc. in an attempt to make using a Proffieboard as beginner-friendly as possible, while still retaining as much of the powerful customization which makes Proffie so popular.

## Getting Started

Head over to the [latest ProffieConfig release](https://github.com/ryryog25/ProffieConfig/releases/latest), grab either the macOS or Windows (Win32) version depending on which you use, unzip the folder, and run it! 

ProffieConfig will guide you through the setup and all of it's features, so whether you're a first-time proffieboard user or have been around the block a few times, you'll be ready in no time!

## To-Do (Non-Exhaustive)
- Expand pre-checker capabilities (ongoing)
- Implement interface for `using` syntax (not just the ability to parse)
- Add blade nicknames
- Take over the world ;)

All-In-One ProffieBoard Management Utility. 

Incorporates extensive configuration generation, compiling and applying changes to the ProffieBoard, the Serial Monitor, handles driver installation, and some sanity checks for good measure; All without the Arduino IDE. 

Using this tool, there is no need for dealing with the Arduino IDE, Zadig, etc. in an attempt to make using a Proffieboard as beginner-friendly as possible, while still retaining as much of the powerful customization which makes Proffie so popular.

If you have any comments, questions, concerns, or otherwise want to get in contact with me, you can do so via the channels listed below. Note that for reporting bugs for the application itself, I'd prefer if you create an "Issue" on GitHub, though feel free to also reach out separately. I check all these places pretty regularly.

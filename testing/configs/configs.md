# Testing Configs

These are primarily config files I've acquired from various places over time.
There's not really any rhyme or reason to them.

Here's a best-effort attribution and info list:

Usernames/company names are listed for ones I recall. Most I don't.
If you see your config/bladestyle/whatever here and you'd like attribution, or you'd prefer it taken down, please reach out to me.

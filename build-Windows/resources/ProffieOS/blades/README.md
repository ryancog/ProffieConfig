# Blades

In ProffieOS, anything that can light up is a "blade". Originally, ProffieOS was used to control lightsabers, and the blade was the only thing that we worried about. Over time, people started adding accent lights, button lights, additional blades and lots of other stuff, and it was easier to just all call them "blades" than to invent new control code for each kind of thing.

In this directory you will find the code for all the blades, including the underlying hardware drivers.
